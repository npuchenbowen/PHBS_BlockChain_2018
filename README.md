# The Change of Bitcoin Price Efficiency—A Dynamic Method and Multi-exchange Data
## Abstract
This paper uses DFA method to calculate Hurst exponent. Additionally, this paper takes the advantage of rolling window method with BDS test for each window to test the robustness of DFA method. Furthermore, this paper has three findings: 
  (1) The distribution of the return of Bitcoin is approximate to normal distribution since the middle of 2017. 
  (2) The Bitcoin market is an inefficient market in short period and the inefficiency will weaken if you hold Bitcoin for a longer period. 
  (3) The inefficiency weakens since the big fluctuations of Bitcoin price around 2016.7.31. 
## 1. Introduction
Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and it has received a lot of attention from the world because of the great price fluctuations (Nakamoto, 2008). Chan, Le and Wu (2019) wrote that Bitcoin could hedge against S&P 500, Shanghai A-Share, Nikkei, TSX Index and Euro STOXX under monthly frequency. Bouri et al. (2017) revealed that Bitcoin was a good diversifier which could hedge against Asia Pacific stocks. Dyhrberg (2016) suggested that Bitcoin shared some hedging abilities with gold. As time goes by, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a popular investment choice. Therefore, whether the price of Bitcoin is efficient is causing more and more discussion because investors want to know how to predict price.  
The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is the basic theory used to analyze market efficiency (Fama,1970). Fama divides the efficient market into three levels: The Weak-Form EMH, The Semi-Strong-Form EMH and The Strong-Form EMH. In the Weak-Form EMH, all previous price information has been reflected in the current price, technical analysis is invalid; In the Semi-Strong-Form EMH, fundamental analysis relying on public information such as financial statements is also invalid; in the Strong-Form EMH, the people who have inside information are also unable to obtain sustained abnormal returns.  
According to the research of Urquhart (2016), the returns of Bitcoin are significantly inefficient in general but the market is more efficient in the latter period. Nadarajah and Chu (2017) reveals that the Bitcoin returns satisfy the requirements of Weak-Form EMH with using eight various tests. Bariviera (2017) is the first to use Hurst exponent in the research about Bitcoin price efficiency and it found that DFA method was much more precise. Tiwari et al. (2018) supported their results with using a long-range efficient estimator of dependence. Jiang, Nie and Ruan (2018) suggested that the Hurst exponents of Bitcoin market were higher than 0.5, Bitcoin market was inefficient and it did not develop more and more efficiently, and rolling window approach could improve the results. Vidal-Tomás (2018) was the first one to analyze the Semi-Strong-Form EMH of Bitcoin and revealed that Bitcoin would not respond to monetary policy news and Bitcoin Market has become more efficient in relation to its own events. Sensoy (2019) proved that the price efficiency has improved in the recent years.  
We aim to analyze the change of Bitcoin Price Efficiency since the birth of Bitcoin and initially explore what causes the price efficiency change. Additionally, this paper will compare the different Bitcoin Price Efficiency among different exchanges. 
This paper has two innovative points. Firstly, we combine the Hurst exponent, DFA method and rolling window approach together to get the accurate description of Bitcoin Price Efficiency in a dynamic way with BDS test. Secondly, this article will establish a horizontal comparison of the Bitcoin Price Efficiency of different exchanges in different time periods.
## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Hurst Exponent
### 2.2 DFA Method (Peng et al., 1995)
### 2.3 Rolling Window Approach
## 3. Data and Results
## 4. Conclusion
This paper’s data is based on the Coinbase, Exmo and Binance Exchanges. In the analysis of the descriptive statistics characters of the data, we found that the distribution of the return series of Bitcoin is close to normal distribution and it can help Bitcoin investors to predict the future price of Bitcoin in different exchanges. In the part of DFA analysis, we indicated that the Bitcoin market was an inefficient market overall because that the DFA exponent was always larger than 0.5. At the same time, when we enlarged the size of rolling window method, we found  that the DFA exponent was declining which meant that the Bitcoin market would become less inefficient when  investors held it for a longer time. Therefore, we recommends that the investors can buy the Bitcoin when the price is increasing and sell the Bitcoin when the price is decreasing in the short period. Additionally, we do not suggest that the investors should hold Bitcoin for a long time because they will face larger risk and uncertainty. In the part about BDS test, it supports our findings that the Bitcoin market is an inefficient market overall. What’s more, it suggests that the inefficiency weakens since the big fluctuations of Bitcoin price in 2016.7.31 which can also slightly supported by DFA exponent analysis.
